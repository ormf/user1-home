;;; The following paths are the defaults, where sfz and soundfiles are
;;; located in the clamps repository. In order to be able to pull
;;; updates of clamps later on it is advisable to add your own sfz
;;; files and soundfiles into a folder of your choice and push this
;;; folder as a pathname to the *sfz-preset-path* and *sfile-path*
;;; variables. All directories listed in *sfile-path* or
;;; *sfz-preset-path* will get searched recursively for soundfiles or
;;; sfz files respectively. Additional sfz associations between the
;;; preset keyword and an sfz file should be added using the
;;; "add-sfz-assoc" function.
;;;
;;; Example (you can add the example code at the end of this file to
;;; load it each time, cm/clamps is loaded):
;;;
;;; Soundfiles in "$HOME/snd", an sfz file of the name "clarinet.sfz"
;;; in "$HOME/snd/sfz" :
;;;
;;; (push "~/snd" *sfile-path*)
;;; (push "~/snd/sfz" *sfz-preset-path*)
;;; (add-sfz-assoc :clarinet "clarinet.sfz")
;;;
;;; After this, (sprout (new sfz :time 0 :preset :clarinet)) should
;;; use the clarinet.sfz file to output a sound of keynum 60 for 0.5
;;; seconds.
